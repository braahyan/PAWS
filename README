export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=__YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_HERE__

The AWS access key needs permissions to administer the account. Right now I have only tested with the administrator access role, but will be updating this as I gain a greater understanding of the AWS permissions model.

The AWS role supplied above must have a trust policy set up that has a trust relationship with both Lambda and API Gateway, additionally, it should have the "lambda:InvokeFunction" permission associated with it.



example main invocation.
python main.py --api_name foobar --path /test main.zip asdf main.lambda_handler __arn_for_lambda/gateway_user__ POST
